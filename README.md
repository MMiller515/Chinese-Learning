I've created an HSK flashcard program with pinyin and tone options and English translations for the HSK study. If you're interested in learning Mandarin Chinese, this contains characters from the (old) HSK books. Feel free to expand or adjust to your requirements. I've included texts up to HSK 3 and added placeholders for the HSK 4, 5, and 6 dictionaries. I'm currently in HSK 3 and plan to update 4 once I begin that course. I hope you enjoy it!
